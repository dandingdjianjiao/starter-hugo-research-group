abstract: A new and atom-economic palladium-catalyzed aminomethylamination of
  allenes with aminals by C–N bond activation is described. This direct and
  operationally simple method provides a fundamentally novel approach for the
  synthesis of 1,3-diamines. Mechanistic studies suggest that a unique cationic
  π-allylpalladium complex containing an aminomethyl moiety is generated as a
  key intermediate through the carbopalladation of the allene with a
  cyclometalated palladium–alkyl species.
